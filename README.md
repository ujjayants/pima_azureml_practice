This repo contains my practice code for Azure Machine Learning using both SDK v1 and SDK v2. I used the Pima Indians diabetes prediction dataset for this purpose.

1. 01-Train-Register-Model: Loading data, pre-processing and then training the model. Then registering the trained model and relevant artifacts in the model registry using both SDK v1 and SDK v2.

2. 02-Deploying-Online-Endpoint: Taking the model and artifacts registered in (1) and deploying them as an online enpoint using both SDK v1 and SDK v2.

3. 03-Deploying-Batch-Endpoint: Taking the model and artifacts registered in (1) and deploying them as a batch enpoint using both SDK v1 and SDK v2.

4. 04-Create-Pipeline: Training, registering and inference pipeline using SDK v1 and SDK V2.
